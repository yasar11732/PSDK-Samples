<H2>Simple Database Application using ADO</H2>

<H3>Sample Overview</H3>
<P>The SimpleDB sample application highlights some of the most fundamental operations
you may perform with an ADO Recordset. Once you have opened SimpleDB.vbp, you may either 
run the program immediately or browse the source in each of the different forms.   
Within the sample you will find different forms that highlight different ADO operations. 
A list of the forms and the operation they are intended to highlight are:</P> 

<P>frmAddEmployee.frm</P>
This form will allow you to create employee records.  Upon a sucessful add the program will 
display the new EmployeeID.

<P>frmBrowse.frm   </P>
This form will allow you to browse the records within the employee table using a form view.
It should be noted that the Recordset is read-only and the edit boxes have the lock-flag = true to 
prevent editing the records.  This form is intended to show you how to navigate a recordset by
using MoveFirst, MoveNext, MoveLast, MovePrevious Recordset methods.
 
<P>frmDbLogin.frm</P>
This is the intial form you will see.  It's main purpose is to gather information in order
to call the OpenSql() function with the appropriate credentials. 

<P>frmDeleteEmployee.frm</P>
As the name of the form gives it away, this form highlights deleting a record from the database.

<P>frmEditEmployee.frm</P>
This form demonstrates editing an existing record within the database.  One item of interest
is the way in which the records are fetched.  As the form is loaded the entire set of employee records 
is fetched.  This is not recommended for real world applications but was simply done in order to show 
the user how to Filter over a given RecordSet. Once an EmployeeID has been entered the RecordSet will 
be filtered and it's values displayed accordingly.
    
<P>frmListEmployees.frm</P>
This form displays a grid containing employee records from the database. Interesting features of this 
form include how the grid control is bound to a recordset and the use of the Recordset Sort propery. 

<P>frmSelectAction.frm</P>
This form is the main menu for the program and will display the appropriate form based on the user's 
selection.

<P>basSimpleDb.bas</P>
This module has the main subroutine which is the starting point for the program. In addition to 
the program's sub main, the file contains the one utility function for opening connection to a SQL 
Server database and may be useful in projects of your own.
