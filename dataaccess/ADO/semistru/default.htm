<H2>Accessing Semi Structured data Using the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Internet Publishing</H2>

<P>This sample uses the ability of ADO and OLE DB providers which support the OLE DB 2.5 extensions to access data which is semi structured.
That is data that has structure which does not fit in the model of tables with identically structured rows. In the sample some of the rows (those
corresponding to directories) are not flat rows but contain a collection of "sub elements". ADO using the ADO record object's GetChildren method exposes
these collections as recordsets.</P> 

<P>The Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Internet Publishing can be used to access a file system identified by a URL. The provider uses http to access the URL</P>

<P>The sample Visual Basic application uses ADO and the Internet Publishing provider to provide windows explorer like 
functionality for a remote file system identified by a URL. The ADO record object and its GetChildren method are used to 
navigate the hierarchical directory structure. </P>

<H3>System Requirements</H3>

<P>This sample assumes that you have a  Microsoft Windows NT 4 or Windows2000 
	Server system with Visual Basic 6.0 installed.
</P>

<H3>Setup</H3>
<P>Setup this sample by following the steps below:</P>

  <LI>Run the sample. <BR>
