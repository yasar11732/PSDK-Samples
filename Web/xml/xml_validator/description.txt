XML Validator

Files:
validate.htm
WeatherReport.xml
WeatherSchema.xml

Description:
This web page allows you to enter in the URL of an XML document and both parse and validate that 
document.  This demo utilizes the new validation support (XML schemas, validateOnParse property, etc.).
To run the validator on this site, enter in the following URL: "WeatherReport.xml".

The new MSXML parser that ships with Internet Explorer 5 now supports XML schemas as 
a way to define content models.  XML Schema can now be used to validate XML data against.

The new validateOnParse property gives the web application builder more control over what actions are
taken with the document she is downloading.  In some cases, validating the document may be an 
unnecessary step.  In other cases, validation may be required.  

More Details:
When entering a URL, be aware that, for security reasons, you cannot access data across protocols.
Therefore, if you load the page via http, you can only access data via http.  The same goes
for other protocols.

This validator can be used with both XML schemas and DTDs.

Compatibility/Platform Compatibility:
This demo requires Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 or greater on Win32 or Unix platforms.
