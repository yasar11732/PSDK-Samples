Description:
This is simple MFC C++ application that populates a Tree Control from a loaded XML Document. The user can then navigate the XML document by expanding and collapsing nodes of the tree. 

This sample was adapted from original source code from Soo-Young Oh (syoh@t2000.co.kr). 

Compatibility/Platform Compatibility:
The executable xmltree.exe is a standalone MFC application that requires no other installation.
