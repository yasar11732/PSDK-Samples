Description:
This demo is a Visual Basic application that allows the user to build XSL patterns and use 
those patterns to retrieve XML nodes from an XML document.  This demo loads and parses the 
XML document using the MSXML parser that ships with Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.  It
also uses the XML Object Model to retrieve nodes based on XSL pattern matching.

This is a great tool for learning the syntax for XSL patterns.  It is also a good example of 
how to use the MSXML parser from Visual Basic.

Compatibility/Platform Compatibility:
This demo was built using Visual Basic 6.0 and accesses the MSXML.DLL that ships with Microsoft's Internet Explorer 5.
