XML Book Finder

Files:
bookFinder.htm
bookStore.xml
booksTable.xsl

Description:
This is a simple searching application written in JScript that uses XSL pattern-matching to retrieve requested
nodes and XSL stylesheets to display those nodes.  In this case, the user can search a 
bookstore's inventory by title or author.

The select boxes in the demo above are generated dynamically from the data within the XML document.  
Expand the XML containing the list of books and the choices will expand, as well.  

More information on the XSL pattern-matching syntax can be found in the XML reference documentation on the workshop. 
More information on the XML object model and, specifically, the selectNodes method can be found there, as well.



Compatibility/Platform Compatibility:
You must be running Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 or greater on Win32 or Unix platforms to view this demo.
