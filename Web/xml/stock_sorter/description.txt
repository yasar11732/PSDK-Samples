Description:
This demo is an example of using Internet Explorer 5 to browse XML.  The XML file
has an XSL stylesheet associated with it ("stock-sorter.xsl").  The HTML generated
by this stylesheet can rerun portions of the stylesheet to update the display in
response to user requests for different sorting criteria.

Compatibility/Platform Compatibility:
You must be running Internet Explorer 5 or greater on Win32 platforms to view this demo.

Usage:
Internet Explorer 5 can be used to view XML documents with XSL.  The XMLDocument
and XSLDocument properties of the document object can be used to simulate refreshes
to the display when the XML data or stylesheet changes.
